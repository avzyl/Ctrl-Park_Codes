Ctrl+Park License Plate Detection Setup Guide
=============================================

1. Install Python
-----------------
Make sure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your device.
You can download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Dependencies
-----------------------
Open a terminal in this folder and run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add YOLO Model
-----------------
Place your trained YOLO model file at:

    runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt

If you want to use a different path, update the script accordingly.

4. Run the App
--------------
Start the application by running:

    python your_script_name.py

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual filename.

5. Access the Web Interface
---------------------------
Open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:5000/

If you're on another device in the same network, use the host machine's IP:

    http://<your-local-ip>:5000/

6. Optional: Preload Authorized Plates
--------------------------------------
To authorize specific plate numbers, open `plates.db` using a SQLite browser
and insert them into the `authorized_plates` table.

7. Troubleshooting
------------------
- If the webcam isn't working, make sure it's connected and not used by another app.
- If you see errors about missing packages, double-check your Python version and re-run step 2.
- For GPU acceleration, ensure your device has CUDA installed and compatible drivers.

Enjoy your smart parking system!
